# Project-3-COVID19-Data-Visualisation

Please refer to the Project Proposal File for more information about the project details.

1. To run the program, create a config.py file. In there, store your password to run the Postgres.

2. Next, make sure your Pandas version is at least 1.5 or newer, setup the Postgres with the database, running the covid.sql to create all the schema ready. Then running the main.ipynb file to start scraping the data as well as the cleaning process.

3. Thirdly, running the app.py. This is the Flask to run the API as well as generating all the web pages with the main page (index.html)

### Purpose of the assignment

    The aim of our project is to explore and uncover patterns in COVID-19 case data within
    Australia. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between case numbers over time, between different
    states, and compared to vaccination and hospitalisation rates.

    This will involve retrieving current and historical COVID-19 case data from websites that
    report it, listed below under data sources. This data will be stored in an SQL database,
    cleaned and organised as necessary, then visualised. The nature of COVID-19 reporting
    means that the visualisations produced will be live, meaning that they will be updated
    automatically.

### Data sources:

    -https://covidlive.com.au
    -https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/case-numbers-and-statistics
    -https://nationalmap.gov.au/

</br>

### Process of the project

1. main.ipynb we scrape the websites and retrieve the database then we clean the dataset
1. covid.sql which was kept in the Resources where we created 8 tables in PostgreSQL
1. app.py is the python file where we create all the routes and retrieved the data to json format.
1. js Libaries and CSS

- Leaflet and D3js : we created the homepage australia map
- Chart js and it's annotation plugin: we imported the libary which we haven't learnt before to desgin the line charts and the bar charts.

### Visualisation & comparison

1. Here is our homepage:
   On the navbar by clicking the **state** button, you can link each state's page and by clicking the **comparison** button
